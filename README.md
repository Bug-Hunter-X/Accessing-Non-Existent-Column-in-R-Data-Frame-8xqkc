# R Bug: Accessing Non-Existent Column

This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming: attempting to access a column in a data frame that does not exist.  The `bug.R` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.R` provides the corrected version.

The error arises from trying to perform operations on a column (`C`) that is not present in the data frame `data`.

Solutions involve either careful checking of column names or using error-handling techniques.
